# CortexFlow: Autonomous AI-Driven Data Workflow Architect

**CortexFlow** will be an AI-driven system designed to autonomously generate and optimize data workflows, using techniques like Vector Databases, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and workflow orchestration (e.g., Airflow).

## Project Status
- Currently in planning stage.
- Will showcase AI-driven data pipeline creation and optimization.
- Full-stack project covering Data Engineering, AI/ML, and System Design.

## Tech Stack
- **Data Engineering**: Airflow, Spark, Kafka, Delta Lake
- **Vector DBs**: FAISS, Pinecone
- **AI/ML**: RAG models, LLMs (Llama, GPT-3)
- **Orchestration**: Airflow, Dagster
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Getting Started
More details coming soon!
